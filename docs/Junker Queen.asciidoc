== Counters

Reinhardt: Junker Queen's close-range attacks can easily overwhelm Reinhardt's barrier, applying consistent pressure and forcing him to make unfavorable decisions.

Wrecking Ball: His ability to displace and confuse the enemy can interrupt Junker Queen's flow in battle, making it hard for her to utilize her abilities efficiently.

Roadhog: His self-healing and high burst potential can negate the effectiveness of Junker Queen's abilities, especially if he hooks her before she can retaliate.

== Countered By

Ana: Her healing abilities can negate Junker Queen's healing from damage, making it difficult for her to sustain herself in fights.

Pharah: With vertical mobility and ranged attacks, Pharah can stay out of Junker Queen's reach, whittling her health down from a distance.

Mei: Mei's freezing ability can incapacitate Junker Queen, preventing her from utilizing her kit effectively in close quarters, especially if caught off-guard.
