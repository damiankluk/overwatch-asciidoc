== Strategy
Ana excels in the backline, providing sustained healing for her team while dealing damage to opponents. Positioning is crucial; she should stay out of reach of enemy flankers while maintaining line-of-sight to heal allies. 

* **Offense**: Focus on using Biotic Grenade to disrupt enemy healing and damage. Aim for headshots with the Biotic Rifle to maximize output.
* **Defense**: Stay near teammates, utilizing the Sleep Dart to incapacitate high-threat enemies and Biotic Grenade to support allies while keeping enemies at bay.
* **Team Fights**: Prioritize healing over damage when teammates are low. Use Nano Boost on high-damage dealers like Reaper or Soldier: 76 to turn the tide of battle.
