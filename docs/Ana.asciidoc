In offense scenarios, position yourself away from the front lines to maximize your healing output without being threatened. In defense, use the environment to your advantage, and prioritize healing the tank and damage dealers. During team fights, coordinate your ultimate with your team’s strategies, and look for opportunities to use Sleep Dart on key enemy threats, like flankers or ult-charging heroes.

- High potential damage output with her Biotic Rifle when played effectively.

Cons:
- Vulnerable to flanks and enemies who can close the gap quickly.

Tracer: Tracer can quickly close the gap and evade Ana’s shots, making it hard for her to heal while also being a high-priority target.
Reaper: Reaper can sustain through Ana’s damage while closing in quickly to eliminate her if not kept at a distance.

== Countered By
