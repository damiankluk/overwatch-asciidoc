Baptiste is best played as a healer who provides ongoing support in team fights. Positioning is crucial for him, as staying near teammates allows him to utilize his AOE healing effectively.

On defense, the Immortality Field is critical for preventing picks during team fights. Baptiste can use his Transpose ability strategically to escape dangerous situations or to aid allies in retaliation.
