== Strategy
Doomfist excels in flanking and engaging backline support and damage heroes. Utilizing Rocket Punch for high-impact kills can quickly shift the momentum of a team fight. Power Block is essential for mitigating damage before engaging, while Seismic Slam provides mobility and situational awareness.
