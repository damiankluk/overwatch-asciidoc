= Bastion

== Description
Bastion is a robotic hero in Overwatch, known for its unique ability to transform into a powerful turret. Once a part of the Omnic Crisis, Bastion served as a weapon of destruction during the conflict. However, after the war, Bastion deactivated and entered a peaceful, contemplative state for decades. In recent times, it has reawakened amidst ongoing warfare, seeking to understand humanity while still wielding significant firepower. With its adaptive capabilities, Bastion is both a symbol of the technological conflict and a tool for change.

Bastion excels in holding positions and can deal massive damage when set up properly in Sentry mode. It is best utilized in maps with good sightlines and ambush opportunities. In team fights, positioning is essential; find cover and maintain sightlines while tanking damage for allies. It is important to switch to Recon mode when repositioning or needing mobility. In general, avoid getting flanked and keep an ally close to provide protection.

- Self-repair allows for sustainability when positioned correctly.

Cons:
- Vulnerable when not set up in Sentry mode.
