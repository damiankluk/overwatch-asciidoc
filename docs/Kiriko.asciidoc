== Strategy
In team fights, Kiriko should be positioned safely to support allies while using Healing Ofuda to maintain their health. She excels in providing burst healing and utility in chaotic situations. During offense, teleporting to allies under fire can save them while allowing Kiriko to reposition quickly. On defense, her Protection Suzu cleanses important crowd control effects, making it vital to use at critical moments.

== Pros and Cons

Pros:
- High mobility with Swift Step enables fast repositioning.
- Powerful healing capability with the ability to heal multiple allies quickly.
- Unique cleansing ability that can turn the tide by removing debuffs.

Cons:
- Limited health pool makes her vulnerable.
- Skills require good timing and positioning to maximize effectiveness.
- Relies on aiming precision with Kunai for damage output.

== Counters

- Moira: Kiriko can counter Moira by cleansing her Biotic Grasp with Protection Suzu, neutralizing her healing effect.
- Baptiste: When timed correctly, Protection Suzu can remove Baptiste's Amplification Matrix debuff.
- Mercy: Kiriko's quick healing can outmatch Mercyâ€™s healing over time, especially if she catches Mercy out of position.

== Countered By

- Reaper: His close-range damage output can quickly eliminate Kiriko, especially while she has no escape options.
- Widowmaker: Kiriko's low health makes her an easy target for Widowmaker's long-range shots.
- Sombra: A hacked Kiriko loses access to her healing abilities, making her extremely vulnerable to attack.
