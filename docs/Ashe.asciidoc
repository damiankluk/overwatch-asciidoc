= Ashe

== Description
Ashe is a damage hero in Overwatch, known for her sharp shooting skills and tactical acumen. The leader of the Deadlock Gang, she has a rebellious spirit and a knack for invention, especially with her weaponry. Her signature weapon is the Viper, a lever-action rifle that can be fired rapidly for lower damage or charged for a more powerful shot. Ashe is also accompanied by a robotic companion, Bob, who can provide additional firepower and crowd control on the battlefield. With a combination of strategy, teamwork, and firepower, Ashe excels in the hands of players who master her diverse abilities.

== Abilities

Viper: Ashe's primary weapon is a lever-action rifle that deals damage at medium to long range. The standard shot deals 80 damage, and a scoped shot can deal 200 damage. (Cooldown: N/A)

Dynamite: Ashe throws a stick of dynamite that explodes after a short delay or upon igniting after contact with a target, dealing 100 damage in an area. If enemies are hit by the explosion, they are set on fire, dealing an additional 50 damage over 5 seconds. (Cooldown: 10 seconds)

== Strategy
Ashe thrives at mid to long ranges, using cover to her advantage while strategically positioning herself on the battlefield. In team fights, utilize Dynamite to zone enemies or deal damage to grouped targets, and then follow up with Viper shots to finish off weakened foes. Coach Gun is essential for escaping sticky situations or getting the jump on unsuspecting enemies. Bob can serve as a great distraction or frontline fighter, allowing Ashe to support from a safer distance.

In offensive scenarios, Ashe can flank or provide consistent damage from range. Defensively, she should take advantage of her superior range to poke at enemies before they engage. In larger team fights, coordinating with teammates to focus fire while using her abilities can quickly turn engagements in Ashe's favor.
