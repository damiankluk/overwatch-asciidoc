== Strategy
Wrecking Ball excels in mobility, positioning himself in a way to disrupt the enemy team effectively. In offensive scenarios, players should utilize Grappling Claw to swing into enemy groups and use Piledriver to knock them back and create chaos. Adaptive Shield is crucial for surviving engagements, especially when surrounded by enemies. 

On defense, Wrecking Ball can use Minefield to zone enemies from objectives, making it risky for them to approach. His speed allows him to traverse the battlefield quickly, which is useful in creating local distractions or picking off isolated foes.

During team fights, make use of your mobility to flank and create opportunities for your team. Activate Adaptive Shield before diving into enemy lines to increase your survivability.
