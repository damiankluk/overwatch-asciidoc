== Strategy
D.Va excels in team fights and can be played both defensively and offensively. In offensive scenarios, utilize Boosters to dive onto enemy supports or high-value targets, using Fusion Cannons to damage them quickly. In defensive play, she's able to protect her teammates with Defense Matrix, absorbing critical incoming damage. 

During the ultimate phase, use Self-Destruct in crowded area to create space for the team or to secure elimination of key targets. Always be mindful of positioning so you can call your mech back promptly in case you are ejected.

Cons:
* Vulnerable when out of her mech.
* Fusion Cannons have limited range.

== Counters

Reaper: D.Va's low range on her primary weapon makes it difficult to engage Reaper, who can mass damage in close-range proximity.

Bastion: D.Va's Defense Matrix can significantly mitigate Bastion's damage, allowing her to counter his stationary mode effectively.

Pharah: D.Va can chase down Pharah with her mobility, but should be careful of getting picked off before reaching her.

== Countered By

McCree: His high damage output and stun with Flashbang can incapacitate D.Va quickly, leading to a swift kill.

Roadhog: Roadhog can hook D.Va out of her mech, making her an easy target for his high burst damage.

Zarya: Zarya can easily counter D.Va by using her Graviton Surge to immobilize her and her mech, allowing teammates to deal damage while D.Va is unable to escape.
