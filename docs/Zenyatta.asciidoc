== Strategy
Zenyatta excels in supporting his team from a distance while providing both healing and damage amplification. In team fights, prioritize placing Orb of Harmony on frontline allies who are engaging or taking damage. Use Orb of Discord to mark priority threats, allowing your team to focus down high-value targets quickly. During clashes, activate Transcendence to counter heavy damage ultimates or when your team is about to be overwhelmed. Avoid facing enemies directly, as Zenyatta is vulnerable to aggressive flanks.

== Pros and Cons

Pros:
* Can heal and damage simultaneously, providing versatile support.
* Has strong damage output, able to eliminate threats quickly.
* Transcendence can turn the tide in fights and is a great counter to burst damage.

Cons:
* Low mobility and health makes him easy to kill if out of position.
* Vulnerable to flanks and burst damage, especially from dive heroes.
* Requires good aim and positioning to be effective with his orbs.

== Counters

Reaper: Zenyatta is particularly vulnerable to Reaper due to his ability to close the distance quickly and deal heavy damage to low-health heroes.

Genji: His mobility allows Genji to dodge Zenyatta's orbs and engage him directly, making it hard for Zenyatta to escape.

Pharah: While Zenyatta can deal damage to her, he struggles to hit targets in the air with his orbs, allowing Pharah to freely attack from above.

== Countered By

Tracer: Tracer's speed and agility allow her to easily dodge Zenyatta's attacks, and her high burst damage can take him down quickly.

Doomfist: His ability to engage quickly and deal significant burst damage can eliminate Zenyatta before he can react or utilize Transcendence effectively.

Widowmaker: With a skilled aim, Widowmaker can pick off Zenyatta from a distance, especially since he has no shields or armor to protect him.
