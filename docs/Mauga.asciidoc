== Strategy
Mauga excels in both offensive and defensive scenarios through his strong crowd control and damage mitigation. In offensive pushes, it is essential to lead with Fortify to absorb enemy fire while providing cover for your team. Use Power Slam to disrupt enemy formations and create openings for allies. During team fights, maintaining pressure with Rampart while using physicality to shield squishier teammates is crucial.

On defense, use your size to control choke points and deny space to the enemy. Fortifying during heavy fire allows you to outlast enemies while wearing them down. Remember to use Guardian's Wrath strategically to turn the tide of battle during critical moments or to secure objectives.
