Junkrat excels in both offensive and defensive positions. On offense, he can use his grenade launcher to apply pressure and zone enemies, forcing them to move or be damaged. Utilize concussive mines to create space, escape dangerous situations, or even launch yourself to high ground. On defense, Junkrat can set up traps in chokepoints to catch unsuspecting enemies. During team fights, position yourself strategically so that you can spam grenades while keeping an eye on the battlefield control, creating chaos for the enemy team. It's essential to remain aware of your surroundings to avoid being isolated or countered.
