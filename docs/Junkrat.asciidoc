= Junkrat

== Description
Junkrat, whose real name is Jamison Fawkes, is a former member of the Omnic Crisis who became a scavenger and demolitions expert in the Australian Outback. He embodies chaos and destruction, using his penchant for explosives to wreak havoc on his enemies. After a series of events in which he lost his leg in an explosion and became enmeshed with his trusty steel-rimmed wheelchair, he embraced the chaotic lifestyle, seeking to create the most massive explosions possible. His obsession with explosions is as much a part of his identity as his laughter-filled cackle that echoes during battle.

== Strategy
Junkrat excels at area denial and zoning due to his explosive abilities. On offense, utilize walls to bounce grenades around corners to deal damage to enemies without exposing yourself. On defense, set traps and concussion mines in expected enemy pathways to deter pushes and secure eliminations. In team fights, coordinate with teammates to distract or control the battlefield while deploying your RIP-Tire to catch multiple enemies off-guard, maximizing its damage potential.

== Pros and Cons

Pros:
- High area damage and control with explosive projectiles.
- Ability to create chaos, making it hard for enemies to predict movements.
- Strong zoning capabilities with his traps and mines.

Cons:
- Low mobility and lack of defense, making him vulnerable to direct attacks.
- Requires precision and good positioning to maximize damage.
- Easy target for snipers and heroes with high burst damage.

== Counters

- **D.Va**: D.Va's Defense Matrix can absorb Junkrat's grenades, but poor positioning can lead to her being caught in his traps.
