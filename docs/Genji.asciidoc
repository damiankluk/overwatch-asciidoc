= Genji

== Description
Genji is a cyborg ninja who excels at mobility and agility. Once a member of the Shimada clan, Genji embraced his new mechanical form after a near-fatal confrontation with his brother, Hanzo. Genji is a master of the blade, utilizing both shuriken and a swift melee attack to dispatch enemies. Drawing on his heritage, he embodies the spirit of the shinobi, moving like a shadow while harnessing the power of his cyborg enhancements to outmaneuver foes. His dedication to mastering himself leads him to become a member of the Shimada clan’s reformed ideals, fighting for peace and justice.

== Strategy
Genji excels in offensive roles, utilizing his mobility to flank and harass enemy supports and backline characters. Use walls and obstacles to engage safely, deflecting incoming attacks before striking. In team fights, prioritize using Dragonblade after engaging with Swift Strike for maximum impact. It’s also crucial to maintain map awareness to escape when needed or to reposition for better offensive opportunities. Genji can be effective against squishier heroes, so try to focus on taking out supports to swing team dynamics in your favor.

- High mobility allows for quick repositioning and evasive maneuvers.
- Strong burst damage potential, especially against isolated enemies.
