== Strategy
Pharah excels at aerial engagements and should be utilized to flank and harass enemies from above. In offense, she can capitalize on her mobility to pick off squishy targets and disrupt enemy backlines. On defense, Pharah can deter pushes from above, forcing opponents to reposition or focus fire, which she can evade with her jetpack. During team fights, situational awareness is vital as Pharah can be vulnerable while using Barrage; thus, timing and positioning are crucial to maximize damage without being taken down.

* Strong aerial mobility makes her difficult to hit.
* Can control the battlefield by targeting enemy support heroes safely from above.

Cons:
* Vulnerable to hitscan heroes and certain crowd control abilities.
* Requires good positioning and map awareness to maximize effectiveness.
