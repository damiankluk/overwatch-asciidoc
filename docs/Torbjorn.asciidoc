* **Defense:** Position Torbjörn and his turret in chokepoints or near objectives to maximize turret effectiveness. Utilize Overload before engaging in fights to increase survivability.
  
* **Offense:** Torbjörn can lead charges into enemy positions, using his turret to pressure opponents while he follows up with his high-damage melee attacks.

* Junkrat: Junkrat's explosives can easily destroy turrets and deal damage from a safe distance.
* Widowmaker: Can take out Torbjörn and his turret from long range without putting herself in danger.

== Countered By
* Winston: His mobility and ability to dive in can quickly dismantle Torbjörn’s defenses.
